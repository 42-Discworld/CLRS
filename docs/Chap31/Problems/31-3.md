> **d.** Assume now that adding two $\beta$-bit numbers takes $\Theta(\beta)$ time and that multiplying two $\beta$-bit numbers takes $\Theta(\beta^2)$ time. What is the running time of these three methods under this more reasonable cost measure for the elementary arithmetic operations?

**a.** $$T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2) + \Theta(1) = \Theta(2^n).$$

**b.**

```cpp
FIB(n)
    fibs = [0, 1] + [-1] * (n - 1)
    return FIB-SUB(n)
```

```cpp
FIB-SUB(n)
    if fibs[n] == -1
        fibs[n] = FIB-SUB(n - 1) + FIB-SUB(n - 1)
    return fibs[n]
```

**c.**

**d.**

1. $\Theta(2^{2^\beta})$.
2. $\Theta(2^\beta)$.
3. $T(n) = T(n / 2) + \Theta(\beta^2) = \Theta(\beta^3)$.
