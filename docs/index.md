# Solutions to Introduction to Algorithms 3rd

Hope to _re-sort_ solutions to help more people and myself study algorithms.
By using .md files, it's much more readable in portable devices now.

Many a little makes a mickle.

Thanks to: the Instructor's Manual by Thomas H. Cormen, @skanev, @cyberzhg, @yinyanghu, @irobot0, @ajl213, etc.

Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback if any adjustment is needed with the sorted-solutions. You can simply press the "Pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the contents.

# Working on following exercises:

18.2-1, 19.2-1, 27.2-1, 27.3-4, 27-3.

# Getting Started

Thanks to [**MkDocs**](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and [**Material for MkDocs**](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)! 

The [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/) is now correctly working and speedy.

I add [overflow-x: auto](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_overflow-x.asp), so you can scroll horizontally in the math display equations.
