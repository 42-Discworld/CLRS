# Solutions to Introduction to Algorithms 3rd

## Getting Started

This website contains nearly complete solutions to the bible textbook - [Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) published by [Thomas H. Cormen](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/thomas-h-cormen), [Charles E. Leiserson](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/charles-e-leiserson), [Ronald L. Rivest](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/ronald-l-rivest) and [Clifford Stein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/clifford-stein).

Hope to _re-sort_ solutions to help more people and myself study algorithms. By using [Markdown(.md)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files, it's much more readable on portable devices now.

Many a little makes a mickle.

Thanks to: the Instructor's Manual by [Thomas H. Cormen](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/thomas-h-cormen), [@skanev](https://github.com/skanev), [@cyberzhg](https://github.com/CyberZHG), [@yinyanghu](https://github.com/yinyanghu), @ajl213, etc.

Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback if any adjustment is needed with the sorted-solutions. You can simply press the "Pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the contents or simply [open an issue](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS/issues/new) in [my repository](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS/).

## Known issue

In the Safari on an iOS device, the math equations of [Problem 1-1](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap01/Problems/1-1/), [16.3-3](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap16/16.3/#163-3) and some other pages won't be rendered. I currently don't know how to fix this. If you know how to tackle this problem, please tell me, thanks.

## Working on following exercises

[18.2-1](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap18/18.2/#182-1), [19.2-1](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap19/19.2/#192-1), [27.2-1](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap27/27.2/#272-1), [27.3-4](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap27/27.3/#273-4), [27-3](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap27/Problems/27-3/).

## How I generate this website

I use the static site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the beautiful theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build this website!

Since there are some LaTeX equations [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) doesn't support, here I use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to render the math equations in my website.

I also add [overflow-x: auto](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_overflow-x.asp) to prevent the overflow issue on mobile devices, so you can scroll horizontally in the math display equations.
