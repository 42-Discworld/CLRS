**a.** The median $x$ of the elements $x\_1, x\_2, \ldots, x\_n$, is an element $x = x\_k$ satisfying $|\{x\_i: 1\le i\le n \text{ and } x\_i < x\}| \le n / 2$ and $|\{x\_i: 1 \le i \le n \text{ and } x\_i > x\}| \le n / 2$. If each element $x\_i$ is assigned a weight $x\_i = 1 / n$, then we get

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{x_i < x} w_i
    & =   \sum_{x_i < x} \frac{1}{n} \\
    & =   \frac{1}{n} \cdot \sum_{x_i < x} 1 \\
    & =   \frac{1}{n} \cdot |{x_i: 1\le i\le n\text{ and } x_i < x}| \\
    & \le \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{n}{2} \\
    & =   \frac{1}{2},
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

and 

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{x_i > x} w_i
    & =   \sum_{x_i > x} \frac{1}{n} \\
    & =   \frac{1}{n} \cdot \sum_{x_i > x} 1 \\
    & =   \frac{1}{n} \cdot |{x_i: 1\le i\le n\text{ and } x_i > x}| \\
    & \le \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{n}{2} \\
    & =   \frac{1}{2},
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

which proves that $x$ is also the weighted median of $x\_1, x\_2, \ldots, x\_n$ with weights $x\_i = 1 / n$, for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$.

**b.** We first sort the $n$ elements into increasing order by $x\_i$ values. Then we scan the array of sorted $x\_i$'s, starting with the smallest element and accumulating weights as we scan, until the total exceeds $1 / 2$. The last element, say $x\_k$, whose weight caused the total to exceed $1 / 2$, is the weighted median. Notice that the total weight of all elements smaller than $x\_k$ is less than $1 / 2$, because $x\_k$ was the first element that caused the total weight to exceed $1 / 2$. Similarly, the total weight of all elements larger than $x\_k$ is also less than $1 / 2$, because the total weight of all the other elements exceeds $1 / 2$.

The sorting phase can be done in $O(n\lg n)$ worst-case time (using merge sort or heapsort), and the scanning phase takes $O(n)$ time. The total running time in the worst case, therefore, is $O(n\lg n)$.

**c.** We find the weighted median in $\Theta(n)$ worst-case time using the $\Theta(n)$ worst-case median algorithm in Section 9.3. (Although the first paragraph of the section only claims an $O(n)$ upper bound, it is easy to see that the more precise running time of $\Theta(n)$ applies as well, since steps 1, 2, and 4 of $\text{SELECT}$ actually take $\Theta(n)$ time.)

The weighted-median algorithm works as follows. If $n \le 2$, we just return the brute-force solution. Otherwise, we proceed as follows. We find the actual median $x\_k$ of the $n$ elements and then partition around it. We then compute the total weights of the two halves. If the weights of the two halves are each strictly less than $1 / 2$, then the weighted median is $x\_k$ . Otherwise, the weighted median should be in the half with total weight exceeding $1 / 2$. The total weight of the "light" half is lumped into the weight of $x\_k$ , and the search continues within the half that weighs more than $1 / 2$. Here's pseudocode, which takes as input a set $X = \{x\_1, x\_2, \ldots, x\_n\}$:

```cpp
WEIGHTED-MEDIAN(X)
    if n == 1
        return x1
    else if n == 2
        if w1 ≥ w2
            return x1
        else return x2
    else find the median xk of X = {x1, x2,..., xn}
        partition the set X around xk
        compute WL = sum\_{xi < xk}(wi) and WG = sum\_{xi > xk}(wi)
        if WL < 1 / 2 and WG < 1 / 2
            return xk
        else if WL > 1 / 2
            wk = wk + WG
            X' = {xi ∈ X: xi ≤ xk}
            return WEIGHTED-MEDIAN(X')
        else wk = wk + WL
            X' = {xi ∈ X: xi ≥ xk}
            return WEIGHTED-MEDIAN(X')
```

The recurrence for the worst-case running time of $\text{WEIGHTED-MEDIAN}$ is $T(n) = T(n / 2 + 1) + \Theta(n)$, since there is at most one recursive call on half the number of elements, plus the median element $x\_k$, and all the work preceding the recursive call takes $\Theta(n)$ time. The solution of the recurrence is $T (n) = \Theta(n)$.

**d.** Let the $n$ points be denoted by their coordinates $x\_1, x\_2, \ldots, x\_n$, let the corresponding weights be $w\_1, w\_2, \ldots, w\_n$, and let $x = x\_k$ be the weighted median. For any point $p$, let $f(p) = \sum\_{i = 1}^n w\_i |p - x\_i|$; we want to find a point $p$ such that $f(p)$ is minimum. Let $y$ be any point (real number) other than $x$. We show the optimality of the weighted median $x$ by showing that $f(y) - f(x) \ge 0$. We examine separately the cases in which $y > x$ and $x > y$. For any $x$ and $y$, we have

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(y) - f(x) & = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i |y - x_i| - \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i |x - x_i| \\
            & = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i (|y - x_i| - |x - x_i|).
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

When $y > x$, we bound the quantity $|y - x\_i| - |x - x\_i|$ from below by examining three cases:

1. $x < y \le x\_i$: Here, $|x - y| + |y - x\_i| = |x - x\_i|$ and $|x - y| = y - x$, which imply that $|y - x\_i| - |x - x\_i| = -|x - y| = x - y$.
2. $x < x\_i \le y$: Here, $|y - x\_i| \ge 0$ and $|x\_i - x| \le y - x$, which imply that $|y - x\_i| - |x - x\_i| \ge -(y - x) = x - y$.
3. $x\_i \le x < y$: Here, $|x - x\_i| + |y - x| = |y - x\_i|$ and $|y - x| = y - x$, which imply that $y - x\_i| - |x - x\_i| = |y - x| = y - x$.

Separating out the first two cases, in which $x < x\_i$, from the third case, in which $x \ge x\_i$, we get

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(y) - f(x) & =   \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i(|y - x_i| - |x - x_i|) \\
            & \ge \sum_{x < x_i} w_i (x - y) + \sum_{x \ge x_i} w_i (y - x) \\
            & =   (y - x) \Bigg(\sum_{x \ge x_i} w_i - \sum_{x < x_i} w_i \Bigg).
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

The property that $\sum\_{x\_i < x} w\_i < 1 / 2$ implies that $\sum\_{x \ge x\_i} w\_i \ge 1 / 2$. This fact, combined with $y - x > 0$ and $\sum\_{x < x\_i} w\_i \le 1 / 2$, yields that $f(y) - f(x) \ge 0$.

When $x > y$, we bound the quantity $|y - x\_i| - |x - x\_i|$ from below by examining three cases:

1. $x\_i \le y < x$: Here, $|y - x\_i| + |x - y| = |x - x\_i|$ and $|x - y| = x - y$, which imply that $|y - x\_i| - |x - x\_i| = -|x - y| = y - x$.
2. $y \le x\_i < x$: Here, $|y - x\_i| \ge 0$ and $|x - x\_i| \le x - y$, which imply that $|y - x\_i| - |x - x\_i| \ge -(x - y) = y - x$.
3. $y < x \le x\_i$: Here, $|x - y| + |x - x\_i| = |y - x\_i|$ and $|x - y| = x - y$, which imply that $y - x\_i| - |x - x\_i| = |x - y| = x - y$.

Separating out the first two cases, in which $x > x\_i$, from the third case, in which $x \le x\_i$, we get

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(y) - f(x) & =   \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i(|y - x_i| - |x - x_i|) \\
            & \ge \sum_{x > x_i} w_i(y - x) + \sum_{x \ge x_i} w_i(x - y) \\
            & =   (x - y) \Bigg(\sum_{x \le x_i} w_i - \sum_{x > x_i} w_i \Bigg).
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

The property that $sum\_{x\_i > x} w\_i \le 1 / 2$ implies that $\sum\_{x \le x\_i} w\_i > 1 / 2$. This fact, combined with $x - y > 0$ and $\sum\_{x > x\_i} w\_i < 1 / 2$, yields that $f(y) - f(x) > 0$.

**e.** We are given $n$ 2-dimensional points $p\_1, p\_2, \ldots, p\_n$, where each $p\_i$ is a pair of real numbers $p\_i = (x\_i, y\_i)$, and positive weights $w\_1, w\_2, \ldots, w\_n$. The goal is to find a point $p = (x, y)$ that minimizes the sum

<div>
$$
f(x, y) = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i(|x - x_i| + |y - y_i|).
$$
</div>

We can express the cost function of the two variables, $f(x, y)$, as the sum of two functions of one variable each: $f(x, y) = g(x) + h(y)$, where $g(x) = \sum\_{i = 1}^n w\_i |x - x\_i|$, and $h(y) = \sum\_{i = 1}^n w\_i |y - y\_i|$. The goal of finding a point $p = (x, y)$ that minimizes the value of $f(x, y)$ can be achieved by treating each dimension independently, because $g$ does not depend on $y$ and $h$ does not depend on $x$. Thus,

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{x, y} f(x, y)
    & = \min_{x, y} (g(x) + h(y)) \\
    & = \min_x \Big(\min_y(g(x) + h(y))\Big) \\
    & = \min_x \Big(g(x) + \min_y h(y)\Big) \\
    & = \min_x g(x) + \min_y h(y).
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

Consequently, finding the best location in 2 dimensions can be done by finding the weighted median $x\_k$ of the $x$-coordinates and then finding the weighted median $y\_j$ of the $y$-coordinates. The point $(x\_k, y\_j)$ is an optimal solution for the 2-dimensional post-office location problem.
