> Let $p$ be an odd prime. A number $a \in Z\_p^*$ is a __*quadratic residue*__ if the equation $x^2 = a ~(\text{mod}~p)$ has a solution for the unknown $x$.

> **a.** Show that there are exactly $(p - 1) / 2$ quadratic residues, modulo $p$.


> **b.** If $p$ is prime, we define the __*Legendre symbol*__ $(\frac{a}{p})$, for $a \in \mathbb{Z}\_p^*$, to be $1$ if $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ and $-1$ otherwise. Prove that if $a \in \mathbb{Z}\_p^*$, then

> $\displaystyle \left ( \frac{a}{p} \right ) \equiv a^{(p - 1) / 2} ~(\text{mod}~ p)$.

> Give an efficient algorithm that determines whether a given number $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. Analyze the efficiency of your algorithm.

> **c.** Prove that if $p$ is a prime of the form $4k + 3$ and $a$ is a quadratic residue in $\mathbb{Z}\_b^*$, then $a^{k + 1} ~\text{mod}~ p$ is a square root of $a$, modulo $p$. How much time is required to find the square root of a quadratic residue $a$ modulo $p$?

> **d.** Describe an efficient randomized algorithm for finding a nonquadratic residue, modulo an arbitrary prime $p$, that is, a member of $\mathbb{Z}\_p^*$ that is not a quadratic residue. How many arithmetic operations does your algorithm require on average?
