> **a.** Parallelize the $\text{LU-DECOMPOSITION}$ procedure on page 821 by giving pseudocode for a multithreaded version of this algorithm. Make your implementation as parallel as possible, and analyze its work, span, and parallelism.
>
> **b.** Do the same for $\text{LUP-DECOMPOSITION}$ on page 824.
>
> **c.** Do the same for $\text{LUP-SOLVE}$ on page 817.
>
> **d.** Do the same for a multithreaded algorithm based on equation $\text{(28.13)}$ for inverting a symmetric positive-definite matrix.
