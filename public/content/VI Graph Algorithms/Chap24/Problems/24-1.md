> Suppose that we order the edge relaxations in each pass of the Bellman-Ford algorithm as follows. Before the first pass, we assign an arbitrary linear order $v\_1, v\_2, \ldots, v\_{|V|}$ to the vertices of the input graph $G = (V, E)$. Then, we partition the edge set $E$ into $E\_f \cup E\_b$, where $E\_f = {(v\_i, v\_j) \in E: i < j}$ and $E\_b = \{(v\_i, v\_j) \in E: i > j\}$. (Assume that $G$ contains no self-loops, so that every edge is in either $E\_f$ or $E\_b$.) Define $G\_f = (V, E\_f)$ and $G\_b = (V, E\_b)$.

We visit each vertex in the order $v\_1, v\_2, \ldots, v\_{|V|}$, relaxing edges of $E\_f$ that leave the vertex. We then visit each vertex in the order $v\_{|V|}, v\_{|V| - 1}, \ldots, v\_1$, relaxing edges of $E\_b$ that leave the vertex.

**a.** Assume for the purpose contradiction that $G\_f$ is not acyclic; thus $G\_f$ has a cycle. A cycle must have at least one edge $(u, v)$ in which $u$ has higher index than $v$. This edge is not in $E\_f$ (by the definition of $E\_f$), in contradition to the assumption that $G\_f$ has a cycle. Thus $G\_f$ is acyclic.

The sequence $\langle v\_1, v\_2, \ldots, v\_{|V|} \rangle$ is a topological sort for $G\_f$, because from the definition of $E\_f$ we know that all edges are directed from smaller indices to larger indices.

The proof for $E\_b$ is similar.

**b.** For all vertices $v \in V$, we know that either $\delta(s, v) = \infty$ or $\delta(s, v)$ is finite. If $\delta(s, v) = \infty$, then $v.d$ will be $\infty$. Thus, we need to consider only the case where $v.d$ is finite. There must be some shortest path from $s$ to $v$. Let $p = \langle v\_0, v\_1, \ldots, v\_{k - 1}, v\_k \rangle$ be that path, where $v\_0 = s$ and $v\_k = v$. Let us now consider how many times there is a change in direction in $p$, that is, a situation in which $(v\_{i - 1}, v\_i) \in E\_f$ and $(v\_i, v\_{i + 1} \in E\_b$ or vice versa. There can be at most $|V| - 1$ edges in $p$, so there can be at most $|V| - 2$ changes in direction. Any portion of the path where there is no change in direction is computed with the correct $d$ values in the first or second half of a single pass once the vertex that begins the no-change-in-direction sequence has the correct $d$ value, because the edges are relaxed in the order of the direction of the sequence. Each change in direction requires a half pass in the new direction of the path. The following table shows the maximum number of passes needed depending on the parity of $|V| - 1$ and the direction of the first edge:

<div>
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
|V| - 1 & \text{first edge direction} & \text{passes} \\
\text{even} & \text{forward}  & (|V| - 1) / 2       \\
\text{even} & \text{backward} & (|V| - 1) / 2 + 1   \\
\text{odd}  & \text{forward}  & |V| / 2             \\
\text{odd}  & \text{backward} & |V| / 2
\end{array}
$$
</div>

In any case, the maximum number of passes that we will need is $\lceil |V| / 2 \rceil$.

**c.** This scheme does not affect the asymptotic running time of the algorithm because even though we perform only $\lceil |V| / 2 \rceil$ passes instead of $|V| - 1$ passes, it is still $O(V)$ passes. Each pass still takes $\Theta(E)$ time, so the running time remains $O(VE)$.
