Modify the $\text{PARTITION}$ procedure to produce a procedure $\text{PARTITION}^\prime(A, p, r)$ which permutes the elements of $A[p..r]$ and returns two indices $q$ and $t$ where $p \le q \le t \le r$, such that

**a.** If all elements are equal, then when $\text{PARTITION}$ returns, $q = r$ and all elements in $A[p..q - 1]$¬ç are equal. We get the recurrence $T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(0) + \Theta(n)$ for the running time, and so $T(n) = \Theta(n^2)$.

**b.** The $\text{PARTITION}^\prime$ procedure:

```
PARTITION'(A, p, r)
    x = A[p]
    i = h = p
    for j = p + 1 to r
        // Invariant: A[p..i - 1] < x, A[i..h] = x, A[h + 1..j - 1] > x, A[j..r] unknown.
        if A[j] < x
            y = A[j]
            A[j] = A[h + 1]
            A[h + 1] = A[i]
            A[i] = y
            i = i + 1
            h = h + 1
        else if A[j] == x
            exchange A[h + 1] with A[j]
            h = h + 1
    return (i, h)
```

**c.** $\text{RANDOMIZED-PARTITION}^\prime$ is the same as $\text{RANDOMIZED-PARTITION}$, but with the call to $\text{PARTITION}$ replaced by a call to $\text{PARTITION}^\prime$.

```python
QUICKSORT'(A, p, r)
    if q < r
        (q, t) = RANDOMIZED-PARTITION'(A, q, r)
        QUICKSORT'(A, p, q - 1)
        QUICKSORT'(A, t + 1, r)
```

**d.** Putting elements equal to the pivot in the same partition as the pivot can only help us, because we do not recurse on elements equal to the pivot. Thus, the subproblem sizes with $\text{QUICKSORT}^\prime$, even with equal elements, are no larger than the subproblem sizes with $\text{QUICKSORT}$ when all elements are distinct.
