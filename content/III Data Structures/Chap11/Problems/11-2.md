> Suppose that we have a hash table with $n$ slots, with collisions resolved by chaining, and suppose that $n$ keys are inserted into the table. Each key is equally likely to be hashed to each slot. Let $M$ be the maximum number of keys in any slot after all the keys have been inserted. Your mission is to prove an $O(\lg n / \lg\lg n)$ upper bound on $\text E[M]$, the expected value of $M$.

**a.** A particular key is hashed to a particular slot with probability $1 / n$. Suppose we select a specific set of $k$ keys. The probability that these $k$ keys are inserted into the slot in question and that all other keys are inserted elsewhere is

<div>
$$
\Big(\frac{1}{n}\Big)^k \Big(1 - \frac{1}{n}\Big)^{n - k}.
$$
</div>

Since there are $\binom{n}{k}$ ways to choose our $k$ keys, we get

<div>
$$
Q_k = \Big(\frac{1}{n}\Big)^k \Big(1 - \frac{1}{n}\Big)^{n - k} \binom{n}{k}.
$$
</div>

**b.** For $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, let $X\_i$ be a random variable denoting the number of keys that hash to slot $i$, and let $A\_i$ be the event that $X\_i = k$, i.e., that exactly $k$ keys hash to slot $i$. From part (a), we have $\Pr\{A\} = Q\_k$. Then,

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
P_k & =   \Pr\{M = k\} \\
    & =   \Pr\Big\{\Big(\max_{1 \le i \le n} X_i\Big) = k\Big\} \\
    & =   \Pr\{\text{there exists $i$ such that $X_i = k$ and that $X_i\le k$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$}\} \\
    & \le \Pr\{\text{there exists $i$ such that $X_i = k$}\} \\
    & =   \Pr\{A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n\} \\
    & \le \Pr\{A_1\} + \Pr\{A_2\} + \cdots + \Pr\{A_n\} \qquad \text{(by inequality (C.19))} \\
    & =   nQ_k.
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

**c.** We start by showing two facts. First, $1 - 1 / n < 1$, which implies $(1 - 1 / n)^{n - k} < 1$. Second, $n! / (n - k)! = n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot (n - 2) \cdots (n - k + 1) < n^k$. Using these facts, along with the simplification $k! > (k / e)^k$ of equation $\text{(3.18)}$, we have

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_k & = \Big(\frac{1}{n}\Big)^k \Big(1 - \frac{1}{n}\Big)^{n - k} \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\
    & < \frac{n!}{n^k k! (n - k)!} & ((1 - 1 / n)^{n - k} < 1) \\
    & < \frac{1}{k!}               & (n! / (n - k)! < n^k) \\
    & < \frac{e^k}{k^k}.           & (k! > (k / e)^k)
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

**d.** Notice that when $n = 2$, $\lg\lg n = 0$, so to be precise, we need to assume that $n \ge 3$.

In part \(c\), we showed that $Q\_k < e^k / k^k$ for any $k$; in particular, this inequality holds for $k\_0$. Thus, it suffices to show that $e^{k\_0} / k\_0^{k\_0} < 1 / n^3$ or, equivalently, that $n^3 < k\_0^{k\_0} / e^{k\_0}$.

Taking logarithms of both sides gives an equivalent condition:

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
3\lg n & < k_0(\lg k_0 - \lg e) \\
       & = \frac{c\lg n}{\lg\lg n}(\lg c + \lg\lg n - \lg\lg\lg n - \lg e).
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

Dividing both sides by $\lg n$ gives the condition

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
3 & < \frac{c}{\lg\lg n} (\lg c + \lg\lg n - \lg\lg\lg n - \lg e) \\
  & = c \Big(1 + \frac{\lg c - \lg e}{\lg\lg n} - \frac{\lg\lg\lg n}{\lg\lg n}\Big).
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

Let $x$ be the last expression in parentheses:

<div>
$$
x = \Big(1 + \frac{\lg c - \lg e}{\lg\lg n} - \frac{\lg\lg\lg n}{\lg\lg n}\Big).
$$
</div>

We need to show that there exists a constant $c > 1$ such that $3 < cx$.

Noting that $\lim\_{n \to \infty} x = 1$, we see that there exists $n\_0$ such that $x \ge 1 / 2$ for all $n \ge n\_0$. Thus, any constant $c > 6$ works for $n \ge n\_0$.

We handle smaller values of $n$—in particular, $3 \le n < n\_0$—as follows. Since $n$ is constrained to be an integer, there are a finite number of n in the range $3 \le n < n\_0$. We can evaluate the expression $x$ for each such value of $n$ and determine a value of $c$ for which $3 < cx$ for all values of $n$. The final value of $c$ that we use is the larger of

- 6, which works for all $n \ge n\_0$, and 
- $\max\_{3 \le n \le n\_0}\{c: 3 < cx\}$, i.e., the largest value of $c$ that we chose for the range $3 \le n < n\_0$.

Thus, we have shown that $Q\_{k\_0} < 1 / n^3$, as desired.

To see that $P\_k < 1 / n^2$ for $k \ge k\_0$, we observe that by part (b), $P\_k \le nQ\_k$ for all $k$. Choosing $k = k\_0$ gives $P\_{k\_0} \le nQ\_{k\_0} < n \cdot (1 / n^3) = 1 / n^2$. For $k > k\_0$, we will show that we can pick the constant $c$ such that $Q\_k < 1 / n^3$ for all $k \ge k\_0$, and thus conclude that $P\_k < 1 / n^2$ for all $k \ge k\_0$.

To pick $c$ as required, we let $c$ be large enough that $k\_0 > 3 > e$. Then $e / k < 1$ for all $k \ge k\_0$, and so $e^k / k^k$ decreases as $k$ increases. Thus,

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_k & <   e^k / k^k \\
    & \le e^{k_0} / k^{k_0} \\
    & <   1 / n^3 
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

for $k \ge k\_0$.

**e.** The expectation of $M$ is

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text E[M] & =   \sum_{k = 0}^n k \cdot \Pr\{M = k\} \\
           & =   \sum_{k = 0}^{k_0} k \cdot \Pr\{M = k\} + \sum_{k = k_0 + 1}^n k \cdot \Pr\{M = k\} \\
           & \le \sum_{k = 0}^{k_0} k_0 \cdot \Pr\{M = k\} + \sum_{k = k_0 + 1}^n n \cdot \Pr\{M = k\} \\
           & \le k_0 \sum_{k = 0}^{k_0} \Pr\{M = k\} + n \sum_{k = k_0 + 1}^n \Pr\{M = k\} \\
           & =   k_0 \cdot \Pr\{M \le k_0\} + n \cdot \Pr\{M > k_0\},
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

which is what we needed to show, since $k\_0 = c \lg n / \lg\lg n$.

To show that $\text E[M] = O(\lg n / \lg\lg n)$, note that $\Pr\\{M \le k\_0\\} \le 1$ and

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Pr\{M > k_0\} & = \sum_{k = k_0 + 1}^n \Pr\{M = k\} \\
               & = \sum_{k = k_0 + 1}^n P_k \\
               & < \sum_{k = k_0 + 1}^n 1 / n^2 & \text{(by part (d))} \\
               & < n \cdot (1 / n^2) \\
               & = 1 / n.
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

We conclude that

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text E[M] & \le k_0 \cdot 1 + n \cdot (1 / n) \\
           & =   k_0 + 1 \\
           & =   O(\lg n / \lg\lg n).
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>
