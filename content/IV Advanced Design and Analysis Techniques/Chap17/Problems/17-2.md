> Binary search of a sorted array takes logarithmic search time, but the time to insert a new element is linear in the size of the array. We can improve the time for insertion by keeping several sorted arrays.

> Specifically, suppose that we wish to support $\text{SEARCH}$ and $\text{INSERT}$ on a set of $n$ elements. Let $k = \lceil \lg(n + 1) \rceil$, and let the binary representation of $n$ be $\langle n\_{k - 1}, n\_{k - 2}, \ldots, n\_0 \rangle$. We have $k$ sorted arrays $A\_0, A\_1, \ldots, A\_{k - 1}$, where for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, k - 1$, the length of array $A\_i$ is $2^i$. Each array is either full or empty, depending on whether $n\_i = 1$ or $n\_i = 0$, respectively. The total number of elements held in all $k$ arrays is therefore $\sum\_{i = 0}^{k - 1} n\_i 2^i = n$. Although each individual array is sorted, elements in different arrays bear no particular relationship to each other.

**a.** The $\text{SEARCH}$ operation can be performed by searching each of the individually sorted arrays. Since all the individual arrays are sorted, searching one of them using a binary search algorithm takes $O(\lg m)$ time, where $m$ is the size of the array. In an unsuccessful search, the time is $\Theta(\lg m)$. In the worst case, we may assume that all the arrays $A\_0, A\_1, \ldots, A\_{k - 1}$ are full, $k = \lceil \lg(n + 1) \rceil$, and we perform an unsuccessful search. The total time taken is

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
T(n) & = \Theta(\lg 2^{k - 1} + \lg 2^{k - 2} + \cdots + \lg 2^1 + \lg 2^0) \\
     & = \Theta((k - 1) + (k - 2) + \cdots + 1 + 0) \\
     & = \Theta(k(k - 1) / 2) \\
     & = \Theta(\lceil \lg(n + 1)\rceil(\lceil \lg(n + 1) \rceil) - 1) / 2) \\
     & = \Theta(\lg^2 n).
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

Thus, the worst-case running time is $\Theta(\lg^2 n)$.

**b.** We create a new sorted array of size $1$ containing the new element to be inserted. If array $A\_0$ (which has size $1$) is empty, then we replace $A\_0$ with the new sorted array. Otherwise, we merge sort the two arrays into another sorted array of size $2$. If $A\_1$ is empty, then we replace $A\_1$ with the new array; otherwise we merge sort the arrays as before and continue. Since array $A\_i$ is of size $2^i$, if we merge sort two arrays of size $2^i$ each, we obtain one of size $2^{i + 1}$, which is the size of $A\_{i + 1}$. Thus, this method will result in another list of arrays in the same structure that we had before.

Let us analyze its worst-case running time. We will assume that merge sort takes $2m$ time to merge two sorted lists of size $m$ each. If all the arrays $A\_0, A\_1, \ldots, A\_{k - 2}$ are full, then the running time to fill array $A\_{k - 1}$ would be

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
T(n) & = 2(2^0 + 2^1 + \cdots + 2^{k - 2}) \\
     & = 2(2^{k - 1} - 1) \\
     & = 2^k - 2 \\
     & = \Theta(n).
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

Therefore, the worst-case time to insert an element into this data structure is $\Theta(n)$.

However, let us now analyze the amortized running time. Using the aggregate method, we compute the total cost of a sequence of $n$ inserts, starting with the empty data structure. Let $r$ be the position of the rightmost $0$ in the binary representation $\langle n\_{k - 1}, n\_{k - 2}, \ldots, n\_0 \rangle$ of $n$, so that $n\_j = 1$ for $j = 0, 1, \ldots, r - 1$. The cost of an insertion when $n$ items have already been inserted is

<div>
$$
\sum_{j = 0}^{r - 1} 2 \cdot 2^j = O(2^r).
$$
</div>

Furthermore, $r = 0$ half the time, $r = 1$ a quarter of the time, and so on. There are at most $\lceil n / 2^r \rceil$ insertions for each value of $r$. The total cost of the $n$ operations is therefore bounded by

<div>
$$
O\Bigg(\sum_{r = 0}^{\lceil \lg(n + 1) \rceil} \bigg(\bigg\lceil \frac{n}{2^r} \bigg\rceil\bigg) 2^r \Bigg) = O(n\lg n).
$$
</div>

The amortized cost per $\text{INSERT}$ operation, therefore is $O(\lg n)$.

We can also use the accounting method to analyze the running time. We can charge $k$ to insert an element. $\$1$ pays for the insertion, and we put $\$(k - 1)$ on the inserted item to pay for it being involved in merges later on. Each time it is merged, it moves to a higher-indexed array, i.e., from $A\_i$ to $A\_{i + 1}$. It can move to a higher-indexed array at most $k - 1$ times, and so the $\$(k - 1)$ on the item suffices to pay for all the times it will ever be involved in merges. Since $k = \Theta(\lg n)$, we have an amortized cost of $\Theta(\lg n)$ per insertion.

**c.** $\text{DELETE}(x)$ will be implemented as follows:

1. Find the smallest $j$ for which the array $A\_j$ with $2^j$ elements is full. Let $y$ be the last element of $A\_j$.
2. Let $x$ be in the array $A\_i$. If necessary, find which array this is by using the search procedure.
3. Remove $x$ from $A\_i$ and put $y$ into $A\_i$ . Then move $y$ to its correct place in $A\_i$ .
4. Divide $A\_j$ (which now has $2^j - 1$ elements left): The first element goes into array $A\_0$ , the next 2 elements go into array $A\_1$ , the next 4 elements go into array $A\_2$, and so forth. Mark array $A\_j$ as empty. The new arrays are created already sorted.

The cost of $\text{DELETE}$ is $\Theta(n)$ in the worst case, where $i = k - 1$ and $j = k - 2: \Theta(\lg n)$ to find $A\_j$, $\Theta(\lg^2 n)$ to find $A\_i$, $\Theta(2^i) = \Theta(n)$ to put $y$ in its correct place in array $A\_i$, and $\Theta(2^j) = \Theta(n)$ to divide array $A\_j$ . The following sequence of $n$ operations, where $n / 3$ is a power of $2$, yields an amortized cost that is no better: perform $n / 3$ $\text{INSERT}$ operations, followed by $n / 3$ pairs of $\text{DELETE}$ and $\text{INSERT}$. It costs $O(n\lg n)$ to do the first $n / 3$ $\text{INSERT}$ operations. This creates a single full array. Each subsequent $\text{DELETE}$/$\text{INSERT}$ pair costs $\Theta(n)$ for the $\text{DELETE}$ to divide the full array and another $\Theta(n)$ for the $\text{INSERT}$ to recombine it. The total is then $\Theta(n^2)$, or $\Theta(n)$ per operation.
