> be a $2 \times 2$ symmetrix positive-definite matrix. Prove that its determinant $ac - b^2$ is positive by ''completing the square'' in a manner similar to that used in the proof of Lemma 28.5.

## 28.3-3

> Prove that the maximum element in a symmetric positive-definite matrix lies on the diagonal.

## 28.3-4

> Prove that the determinant of each leading submatrix of a symmetrix positive-definite matrix is positive.

## 28.3-5

> Let $A\_k$ denote the $k$th leading submatrix of a symmetric positive-definite matrix $A$. Prove that $\text{det}(A\_k) / \text{det}(A\_{k - 1})$ is the $k$th pivot during $\text{LU}$ decomposition, where, by convention, $\text{det}(A\_0) = 1$.

## 28.3-7

> Show that the pseudoinverse $A^+$ satisfies the following four equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
>            AA^+A & = A, \\
