> A pratical method for interpolating a set of points with a curve is to use **cubic splines**. We are given a set $\{(x\_i, y\_i): i = 0, 1, \ldots, n\}$ of $n + 1$ point-value pairs, where $x\_0 < x\_1 < \cdots < x\_n$. We wish to fit a piecewise-cubic curve (spline) $f(x)$ to the points. That is, the curve $f(x)$ is made up of $n$ cubic polynomials $f\_i(x) = a\_i + b\_ix + c\_ix^2 + d\_ix^3$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, n - 1$, where if $x$ falls in the range $x\_i \le x \le x\_{i + 1}$, then the value of the curve is given by $f(x) = f\_i(x - x\_i)$. The points $x\_i$ at which the cubic polynomials are ''pasted'' together are called **knots**. For simplicity, we shall assume that $x\_i = i$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, n$.

> **a.** Suppose that for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, n$, we are given not only the point-value pairs $\{(x\_i, y\_i)\}$ but also the first derivatives $D\_i = f^\prime(x\_i)$ at each knot. Express each coefficient $a\_i$, $b\_i$, $c\_i$ and $d\_i$ in terms of the values $y\_i$, $y\_{i + 1}$, $D\_i$, and $D\_{i + 1}$. (Remember that $x\_i = i$.) How quickly can we compute the $4n$ coefficients from the point-value pairs and first derivatives?

> The question remains of how to choose the first derivatives of $f(x)$ at the knots. One method is to require the second derivatives to be continuous at the knots:
