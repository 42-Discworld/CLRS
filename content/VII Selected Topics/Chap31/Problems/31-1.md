> Most computers can perform the operations of subtraction, testing the parity (odd or even) of a binary integer, and halving more quickly than computing remainders. This problem investigates the __*binary gcd algorithm*__, which avoids the remainder computations used in Euclid's algorithm.

> **a.** Prove that if $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $\text{gcd}(a, b) = 2 \cdot \text{gcd}(a/2, b/2)$.

> **b.** Prove that if $a$ is odd and $b$ is even, then $\text{gcd}(a, b) = \text{gcd}(a, b/2)$.

> **c.** Prove that if $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $\text{gcd}(a, b) = \text{gcd}((a - b) / 2, b)$.

> **d.** Design an efficient binary gcd algorithm for input integers $a$ and $b$, where $a \ge b$, that runs in $O(\lg a)$ time. Assume that each subtraction, parity test, and halving takes unit time.
```python
def binary\_gcd(a, b):
    if a < b:
        return binary\_gcd(b, a)
    if b == 0:
        return a
    if (a & 1 == 1) and (b & 1 == 1):
        return binary\_gcd((a - b) >> 1, b)
    if (a & 1 == 0) and (b & 1 == 0):
        return binary\_gcd(a >> 1, b >> 1) << 1
    if a & 1 == 1:
        return binary\_gcd(a, b >> 1)
    return binary\_gcd(a >> 1, b)```
